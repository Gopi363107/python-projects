🧠 Project Title: Eye-Controlled Mouse using AI and OpenCV
🔍 Project Overview:
This innovative project enables users to control the mouse pointer using only their eye movements, making computing accessible for people with physical disabilities. It uses computer vision and real-time facial landmark detection to track eye position and convert it into cursor movement.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

OpenCV – for real-time face and eye tracking

Dlib / Mediapipe – for facial landmark detection

PyAutoGUI – to simulate mouse actions

NumPy – for mathematical operations

💡 Key Features:
🔍 Tracks eye movements (left, right, up, down)

🎯 Controls mouse pointer based on gaze direction

👁️ Performs click actions using eye blinks

🖱️ Completely hands-free interaction

⚙️ Real-time performance using webcam

🌟 Impact:
This system provides a cost-effective assistive technology for individuals with motor impairments, offering an alternative way to interact with computers using just their eyes.

📽️ Demo Idea:
Include a short video (10–30 seconds) showing:

Webcam tracking your eyes

Cursor moving as your gaze shifts

Clicking via blinking or gaze holding
